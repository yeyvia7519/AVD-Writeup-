Basics of Applied Visual Design 

Use the strong tag, U Tag, em tag, and s tag to show which text is important:
Having a strong tag can make it bold, the u tag will under line, the em tag italicized, and finally the strikethrough tag it will create a horizontal line across the text
Having a strong tag can make it bold, the u tag will underline.

Add a box-shadow to a card-like Element:
The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element. The box-shadow property takes the following values, in order: 
offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element)
offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element)
blur-radius
spread-radius
color
The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.

Colors 

Complementary colors are the opposites of the actual colors being used.

Colors

Textures:
When adding textures into your websites it important remember that it's still a background 
HSL:
HUE: indicates the color with the values between 0 to 360
Saturation: determines how much gray that in the color and the value is in percentage. 

Animation:

Animation is about changing the style of an element inorder to make it something else
There are many properties that can be used to create animations in CSS

To make animations you first need to understand how to use animation rules and the @keyframe rules.¹
animation-name, which sets the name of your animation sequence
animation-duration, which is how long your animation is
@keyframes animation-name, which is where you write the code for the actual animation. You can also set specfic stuff for different parts of the sequence. Such as 0% and 50% done.

Another very simple CSS concept is changing the appearance of things when hoevering over with the mouse. All you have to do is the use :hover property in CSS and then you can set different effects such as font-color, background-color, etc... You can also spice up the hover property by picking whether or not you want the element to stay changed while the mouse is hovering over it or if you want it to return to the previous state. To do this we can use the animation-fill-mode property and either setting it to forwards or backwards. Forwards would make it stay changed while still hovering over the element howver, backwards would revert the element back to normal after the animation is done.²
